# Engineering Intern Interview Questions

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in the Nucleus Security Engineering
internship program! This document contains 2 primary interview
challenges for you. The first is a code review question, and the second
is a coding challenge.

For both, we absolutely encourage the use of AI. If you do use AI, we
would like for you to share your prompts and then answer the follow-up
questions about how you thought through your prompts.

We know this time of the year is crazy for college students and that
your time is very valuable. Please try not to spend more than about 1
total hour collectively on this.

# Code Review (10 minutes)

You are welcome and encouraged to use AI for this section. If you do,
please provide your prompts and answer the questions in the follow-up
section.

## Task

Your colleague or team member was given the following task:

1.  Add a `/webhook` endpoint to receive vendor events about users who
    are vendors.

2.  Input data will look like:

    ``` json
    {"email":"a@b.com","role":"admin","metadata":{"source":"vendor"}}
    ```

3.  Verify signature header `X-Signature`.

4.  Parse JSON and upsert the user data.

5.  Store the raw payload for audit/debug.

They have opened a PR with the code below. Review the code and comment
on any issues you find.

**Note:** Both the PHP and Python do the same thing. You can choose to
review whichever one you want. It is not intended for you to review
both.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PHP

``` php
<?php
// webhook.php
require_once "db.php"; // provides $pdo (PDO instance)

// Config (dev defaults)
$WEBHOOK_SECRET = getenv("WEBHOOK_SECRET") ?: "dev-secret";
$DB_AUDIT_ENABLED = getenv("AUDIT_ENABLED") ?: "true";

function verify_signature($sig, $body, $secret) {
    // Vendor docs: SHA256(secret + body)
    $expected = hash("sha256", $secret . $body);
    return $expected == $sig; // simple compare
}

$method = $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] ?? "GET";
$path = parse_url($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], PHP_URL_PATH);

// Basic routing
if ($method !== "POST" || $path !== "/webhook") {
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "not found";
    exit;
}

$raw = file_get_contents("php://input"); // raw body string
$sig = $_SERVER["HTTP_X_SIGNATURE"] ?? "";

if (!verify_signature($sig, $raw, $WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    http_response_code(401);
    echo "bad sig";
    exit;
}

// Decode JSON
$payload = json_decode($raw, true);
$email = $payload["email"] ?? "";
$role = $payload["role"] ?? "user";

// Store raw payload for auditing / debugging
if ($DB_AUDIT_ENABLED) {
    $pdo->exec("INSERT INTO webhook_audit(email, raw_json) VALUES ('$email', '$raw')");
}

// Upsert user (simple)
$pdo->exec("INSERT INTO users(email, role) VALUES('$email', '$role')");

echo "ok";
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Python

``` python
# app.py
import os
import json
import sqlite3
import hashlib
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)
DB_PATH = os.getenv("DB_PATH", "/tmp/app.db")
WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("WEBHOOK_SECRET", "dev-secret")  # default for dev

def get_db():
    return sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)

def verify(sig, body: bytes) -> bool:
    # Vendor docs: SHA256(secret + body)
    expected = hashlib.sha256(
        (WEBHOOK_SECRET + body.decode("utf-8")).encode("utf-8")
    ).hexdigest()
    return expected == sig  # simple compare

@app.post("/webhook")
def webhook():
    raw = request.data  # bytes
    sig = request.headers.get("X-Signature", "")

    if not verify(sig, raw):
        return ("bad sig", 401)

    payload = json.loads(raw.decode("utf-8"))

    # Example payload:
    # {"email":"a@b.com","role":"admin","metadata":{"source":"vendor"}}
    email = payload.get("email", "")
    role = payload.get("role", "user")

    db = get_db()
    cur = db.cursor()

    # Store raw payload for auditing / debugging
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO webhook_audit(email, raw_json) VALUES ('{email}', '{raw.decode('utf-8')}')"
    )

    # Upsert user
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO users(email, role) VALUES('{email}', '{role}')"
    )

    db.commit()

    return ("ok", 200)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

## Code comments
(python)

Using f-strings to build SQL queries is a security risk because it allows 
user input to be inserted directly into the query, which can lead to SQL injection.<br>
Plain insterts are being used instead of upserts which can cause an error or result 
in duplicate rows of data. <br>
Database connection is opened, but never closed which can lead to recourse issues. <br>
No validation of fields, should through an error if email is empty instead of add ""
into the database. <br> 


(168 and 173) This should use parameterized queries with (?) as a placeholder, so the
values are treated as data instead of SQL. Also change 'INSERT' to 'INSERT ... ON CONFLICT'. <br>
(156) No error handling if the JSON is not valid<br>
(136) If teh secret is missing the app should fail to start

## Follow-up Questions

1.  Share your prompts and the AI outputs.
2.  For each prompt:
    -   Tell us what you were hoping for the AI to accomplish.
    -   Tell us what it actually did.
    -   Did you have to re-prompt it based on its output?
    -   If you had to change your approach, why?
<br>

**Prompt 1**: This can lead to sql injection, right?
``` python
# Store raw payload for auditing / debugging
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO webhook_audit(email, raw_json) VALUES ('{email}', '{raw.decode('utf-8')}')"
    )

    # Upsert user
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO users(email, role) VALUES('{email}', '{role}')"
    )
```
Accomplish: I was fairly certain that this could lead to SQL injection and wnated
to double check. <br>

Actually Did: It answered my question and then gave a fix to the problem.<br>

Change: It gave a little bit more information than I required, so I could have
been more specific in what I wanted in the prompt.<br>
<br>
**Prompt 2**:
Correct syntax for an upsert in sqlite <br>

Accomplish: I knew that the code was just useing a regular INSERT instead of an UPSERT,
but wasn't sure on the correct syntax of one in SQLite. <br>

Acually Did: It answered my question and then explained the key points before showing
a lot of examples. <br>

Change: Just like the last prompt it asnwered my question right at the start, but than continued 
on giving more information than I asked for. Being more spefic seems to be the best course of action,
so there is less left up for interretation.

# Coding Challenge (\~50 minutes)

For the below coding exercise, there is no expectation that you will
have a fully working solution. For anything you feel you didn't
accomplish, please let us know in the follow-up section after the
exercise.

## Exercise

Build a calculator web application. It should include a frontend piece
and any backend logic needed to perform the calculations.

You can use any language of your choosing for both the frontend and
backend code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Follow-up questions

1.  How far were you able to get with the exercise?
2.  What challenges did you encounter in the process?
3.  If you were given unlimited time, what additional functionality
    would you include?
4.  If you used AI, please include all of your prompts and answer the
    following questions:
    -   What did the AI do well?
    -   What did the AI do poorly?
    -   For the places it did poorly, how did you change your approach
